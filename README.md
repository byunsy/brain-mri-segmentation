# brain-mri-segmentation

## Description

Brain-mri-segmentation is a jupyter notebook that utilizes ResNet-50 CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to accurately determine the existence of a tumor using patient brain MRI scans and tumor masks images. Afterwards, I also build a segmentation model to accurately determine the location of predicted brain tumors. To process large sets of high quality images efficiently, I decided to use Google Colab, which allowed me to utilize its GPUs and memory space. The dataset used for this notebook was acquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation). Work in progress.

The general process for the notebook was:

1. Import all necessary packages
2. Attain dataset from Kaggle
3. Understanding the Dataset
4. Data Exploration and Visualization
5. Data Preparation
6. Creating a ResNet-50 model
7. Compiling the CNN model
8. Training the CNN model
9. Visualization of Model Performance
10. Model Prediction

Work in progress.
